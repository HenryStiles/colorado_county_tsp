# Colorado County Seats Road Trip

## Overview

This program determines the shortest possible route to visit all county seats in Colorado, starting from Boulder. It implements three algorithms: Brute Force, Nearest Neighbor, and Branch and Bound. Interestingly, the Nearest Neighbor algorithm proved to be a good heuristic, finding the same shortest route as the Branch and Bound method.

**Important:** None of the code in this program is original; it is compiled from various code snippets found on the web.

## Tour Details

The shortest tour starting and ending in Boulder, CO, visiting all the county seats in Colorado, is as follows:

Boulder, CO -> Broomfield, CO -> Denver, CO -> Littleton, CO -> Golden, CO -> Central City, CO -> Georgetown, CO -> Breckenridge, CO -> Fairplay, CO -> Leadville, CO -> Aspen, CO -> Eagle, CO -> Glenwood Springs, CO -> Meeker, CO -> Craig, CO -> Steamboat Springs, CO -> Walden, CO -> Hot Sulphur Springs, CO -> Fort Collins, CO -> Greeley, CO -> Brighton, CO -> Castle Rock, CO -> Kiowa, CO -> Colorado Springs, CO -> Cripple Creek, CO -> CaÃ±on City, CO -> Westcliffe, CO -> Saguache, CO -> Del Norte, CO -> Alamosa, CO -> Conejos, CO -> San Luis, CO -> Walsenburg, CO -> Trinidad, CO -> Pueblo, CO -> Ordway, CO -> La Junta, CO -> Las Animas, CO -> Lamar, CO -> Eads, CO -> Cheyenne Wells, CO -> Burlington, CO -> Wray, CO -> Holyoke, CO -> Julesburg, CO -> Sterling, CO -> Akron, CO -> Fort Morgan, CO -> Hugo, CO -> Springfield, CO -> Salida, CO -> Gunnison, CO -> Lake City, CO -> Ouray, CO -> Telluride, CO -> Silverton, CO -> Durango, CO -> Cortez, CO -> Dove Creek, CO -> Montrose, CO -> Delta, CO -> Grand Junction, CO -> Creede, CO -> Pagosa Springs, CO -> Boulder, CO
